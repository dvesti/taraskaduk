My name is __Taras Kaduk__ [Tɐ'rɑs Kɐ'duk] _(Ukrainian🇺🇦: Тарас Кадук)_, and this is my website. I occasionally and irregularly write about data analytics and R language. On this site, you can find my posts and projects, as well as the list of recently given talks.

I have a full-time job _(to spare me the hassle of updating this page in the future, just head over to my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taraskaduk), which is always up to date)_, but this blog is my personal endeavor, worked on and updated in my spare time.

I'm pretty active on Twitter under [@taraskaduk](https://twitter.com/taraskaduk). I live in Jacksonville, FL.
