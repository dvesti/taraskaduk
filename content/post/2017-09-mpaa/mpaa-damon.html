<p>About a month ago, I wrote a little article about the MPAA rating system. I set up to find out if their lettering system does any justice to the actual content seen on the screen. Briefly speaking, it does, but with caveats.</p>
<p>One of such caveats was the effect of profanity. What my quick and dirty data analysis showed was that profanity was the sure thing that could send a movie into an R category:</p>

<p>I even wrote this in my <a href="/post/2017-09-mpaa/mpaa/#quote">blog post</a>, when summing up the effects of profanity on movie’s rating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Will Hunting is neither violent nor sexually explicit, but it is profane AF, and, sure enough, is R rated for - wait for it - <em>“strong language, including some sex-related dialogue”.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>When Matt Damon proves you right</h2>
<p>So, a few days ago we were watching <strong>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</strong>, and this bit with Matt Damon caught my instant attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember when people at MIRAMAX came to us and said <em>“Could you make it [Good Will Hunting] <strong>PG-13?</strong>”</em> There’s no violence or sex to speak of, it’s just…</p>
<p>And I said <em>“What’s making it rated <strong>R</strong>?”</em>, and they said <em>“the language”</em>, and I said <em>“Okay well so we could loop a couple lines”</em>, and they go <em>“Yeah but you’re only allowed”</em>… I think at the time you were allowed to say the <strong>F-word</strong> three times, and I said <em>“Okay, well how many are we off by?”</em> And they said <em>“You go over by a hundred and forty-five”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha! So, my theory checks out! It’s profanity that makes a movie R rated! It can be puritan and pacifistic, but you drop a couple of F-bombs — and you’re out.</p>
<p>It is funny that I chose exactly Good Will Hunting as an example of how an otherwise modest movie can be sent straight to the R bench for what Matt claims is how they all talk in Boston.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, that’s it folks. Do more data analysis, for work and for fun.</p>
