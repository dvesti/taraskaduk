## The View from in Here

- We can't compare our happiness to others' happiness because the experience is purely subjective and there is no common denominator (think experiencing colors)
- We can't even compare our happiness now to our happiness earlier (a glass of water in the desert is a 10, while a glass of water after 5 glasses of water is a 2)
- We can be wrong in the present when we say we were happy or unhappy in  the past. Memories of experiences are notoriously unreliable.

## Outside Looking In:

- it is difficult to measure happiness, but it is important to keep in mind that all measuring tools are imperfect in a way, and also we can apply the law of large numbers
- the science of happiness requires that we measure happiness—and if people don't know what they are feeling, then how in the world can they tell us?
- Due to subjectivity, it may be impossible to measure or compare two people's happiness, but //comparing// is not the problem, the issue is //two//. If there are a million data points, we can do a reasonably good job of analyzing the data.

## Stumbling On Happiness: In the Blind Spot of the Mind’s Eye

- Fischer VS Eastman. We imagine how would we feel if we were them, but either they are wrong about how they felt, or we are wrong
- The shortcoming that is causing us to misimagine our future is the same one that disfigures our past and present
- Filling in memory
	- Yield sign VS stop sign experiment

- Filling in perception
	- Blind spot
	- Cookie in a jar and a two year old
	- Realism VS idealism
	- Small, medium and big truck

## Stumbling On Happiness: The Hound of Silence

- More things are left out.
- We remember only the long lines, only the times when a pigeon pooped on us (VS all te times it didn't happen)
- Inability to recognize an absence of a letter in a trigram
- West and East Germany
- When thinking about the distant future, we imagine less details (just like an object far away on the horizon)

## Stumbling on Happiness. The Future Is Now

- the future from 1950s looked pretty much like 1950s. More of the same thing doesn't mean better.
- shopping heavy when being hungry and vice versa
- "I'll never eat again"
- All of this are examples of us imagining how we will feel later based on how we feel now.
- We also tend to think how we felt based on how we feel now
- as imagination /preview/ objects, so does it /prefeel/ events
- When trying to imagine an object, we shut our sight down. When imagining a sound, we don't register sounds around us. But we can't shut down our feelings. Therefore our imagination bears our current feelings

## Stumbling On Happiness. Time Bombs:

- Variety and time
- Prefeeling by comparison:
	- A bad deal that use to be a horrible deal is better than a good deal that used to be a great deal
	- Placing very expensive items next to ordinary ones
	- Saving $100 on a stereo VS on a stereo in a newly purchased car
	- Losing a $20 movie ticket VS $20 and deciding whether to buy a new one

- Our imagination of how we are going to feel later is determined by how we are feeling now, with a slight correction

## Lessons from "Stumbling On Happiness"

1. Imagination's three shortcomings:
  1. its tendency to fill in and leave out without telling us.
  2. its tendency to project the present onto the future.
  3. its failure to recognize that things will look different once they happen.
2. Imagining a future negative event can minimize its impact on our happiness
3. It is important to think in terms of the things "that are not there", things that are missing.
4. When thinking about the future, we must adjust for details just like we adjust when we look far in the the distance.
5. When thinking about the future, we must shut down our current feeling in order to properly "prefeel" the future and not to transfer our current emotional state onto what we imagine will happen later
6. The fallacies of comparison:
	1. Expensive wine next to very expensive wine is not so expensive anymore
	2. Bad deal that used to be a horrible deal is better than a good deal that used to be a great deal
	3. Top brand speakers sound way better compared to a cheaper version, when in the store, but will have to difference for us once we bring them home
	4. Losing a movie ticket vs losing 20 bucks
	5. Driving across town to save on a car stereo vs saving on a car with a stereo.
7. When thinking about the future, we should understand that we are more likely to rationalize some bad events to make us feel better, and we will feel better than we think we will.
8. When thinking about the past, the least likely experiences are the most likely memories
9. When thinking about the past, we store the feeling about an experience that is based on its ending rather than the experience overall.
